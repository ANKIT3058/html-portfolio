<h1>The Best Movies According to Ankit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. It is a wonderful movie on engineering students.
</p>
<h3>Ye Hai Zindagi</h3>
<p>This is again a wonderful movie. Different people see this movie by different perspective, but what I learnt from this movie is that journey is important not the destination. Journey is more beautiful than the destination.</p>
<h3>Chhichhore</h3>
<p>This is also a very good movie which is about college students.</p>
